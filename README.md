# 📖 About
**Sun-Blinded** is a small immersive mod that adds some "realism" and difficulty to Minecraft.
By introducing a simple yet impactful mechanic, it turns an everyday visual detail into a gameplay element with consequences, encouraging players to think twice before exposing themselves to intense sunlight.

Thankfully, not everything is doom and blindness; a pair of sunglasses might just save your eyes.

# ✨ Features
- 😎 **Wearable Sunglasses** – Equip sunglasses in the helmet slot or Curios slot for flexible compatibility and added features.
- 🌞 **Sun Exposure Effects** – Looking directly at the sun comes with visual consequences.
- 👁️ **Immersive Visual Filters** – Custom screen effects simulate glare, exposure, blindness.
- 🕶️ **Eye Protection System** – Sunglasses help negating the sun exposure, but at a cost...

This mod supports multiplayer.  
If you find bugs please report so I can try to fix them.
