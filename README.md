# 📖 About
**Sun-Blinded** is a small immersive mod that adds some "realism" and difficulty to Minecraft.
By introducing a simple yet impactful mechanic, it turns an everyday visual detail into a gameplay element with consequences, encouraging players to think twice before exposing themselves to intense sunlight.

Thankfully, not everything is doom and blindness; a pair of sunglasses might just save your eyes.
