# 📖 About
**Sun-Blinded** is a small immersive mod that adds some "realism" and difficulty to Minecraft.
By introducing a simple yet impactful mechanic, it turns an everyday visual detail into a gameplay element with consequences, encouraging players to think twice before exposing themselves to intense sunlight.

Thankfully, not everything is doom and blindness; a pair of sunglasses might just save your eyes.

# ⚙️ How it works

### Sun Exposure
Looking at the sun for up to 5s builds up sun exposure, gradually triggering visual discomfort effects instead of instant penalties.
* Exposure: Staring at the sun increases exposure intensity over time, which slowly decreases once the player looks away.
* Afterimage: If the player stares at the sun for more than 1 second, an afterimage is generated when they stop looking at it. Its duration and intensity depend on how long the sun was stared at.

### Sun Blindness
Staring at the sun for a full 5 seconds applies the new Sun-Blinded effect, causing the screen to become blurry and decolored. This effect persists until the player dies or drinks milk.

### Sunglasses
Sunglasses are a wearable and dyeable new item that protect the player’s eyes from sun exposure and its effects, at the cost of a dark screen overlay that simulates the reduced brightness of real-life sunglasses.
- Behavior
  * Can be equipped in the helmet helmet slot or in a Curios slot.
  * When equipped in a Curios slot, the sunglasses can be toggled up or down using a dedicated keybind. When toggled up, they behave as if they were not equipped.
